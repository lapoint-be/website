    <h1>Using Scripts to Input Frameworks</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Explanation</h2>
      <p>Before I get too in-depth into why this method may be a better option for any web developers reading this, I should explain what these "Scripted Frameworks" are at a basic level.
      There are many different frameworks out there for developers to use in creating a refined site for personal or professional usage, many of these require the developer to install the package into
      their development environment though. A scripted framework is similar to these in that it is designed to help the developer perform their functions, the difference is in how the framework is introduced.
      These particular frameworks require far less production on the development side to operate, truthfully they usually only require one line of code, and from there it is just a matter of understanding the documentation
      and implementation of the framework in question. This method solely relies upon the <code>script</code> tag pulling the necessary directory of the framework into the html files employing it, meaning the developer only needs
      to know the proper link to source through the script for any of these frameworks to work.</p>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>During my development of this particular site I was asked to introduce Angular components to show my competency in that framework. Unfortunately, I was unable to get Angular working through the route of developing through a
      localhost and porting it up to where I have this site stored. This is almost entirely due to the operating system used by my local system, which wouldn't be an easy fix, but luckily Angular is one of those select
      frameworks that allows it to be referenced through a script call. This simple fragment <code>https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js</code> input into a script tag allows my site to employ
      any of the angular functions that my site might require. From there it was a simple matter of learning the Angular functions to develop the page as I wanted it.</p>

      <p><a href="https://be-lapoint.com/website/angular/" target="_blank">Angular Site</a> in case you are interested in seeing this particular Angular code in action. It is a relatively basic calculator,
      but it updates the answers of the specific functions in real time to eliminate some of the requirements on the user's end. The real issue with something like this is figuring out how to implement the higher
      mathematical functions for the user, such as exponentials, since there isn't any definitive keyboard symbol accepted to run those specific functions. To supplement this unfortunate issue, I manipulated the Angular
      input components so that the user would be able to input their desired numbers without resorting to typing the number out by setting the input type as a number specific format which has the built-in adjustors along the side of
      the input field. The better portion of this project is that due to how the Angular framework was introduced, I didn't have to worry about any src or json files throughout the development, instead focusing on the singular
      file which contained all of the necessary functions with the ability to draw more through the aforementioned script if I needed them.</p>
